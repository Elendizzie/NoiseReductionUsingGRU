# NoiseReductionUsingGRU

Title: Noise Reduction Using GRU.

This is my graduation project in BIT, 2018.

Based on Python3.5 and TensorFlow.

This project learning from adityatb, https://github.com/adityatb/noise-reduction-using-rnn.
adityatb uses LSTM to build noise reduction model.

With the development of RNN, GRU may be a better method to do.

This graduation project will use the database builded by myself and try to use GRU to build noise reduction model.
