# NoiseReductionUsingGRU

Title: Noise Reduction Using GRU(RNN).

This is my graduation project in BIT, 2018.

Based on Python3.5 and TensorFlow.

This project learning from adityatb, https://github.com/adityatb/noise-reduction-using-rnn. adityatb uses LSTM to build noise reduction model.

With the development of RNN, GRU may be a better method to do.

This graduation project will use the database builded by myself and try to use GRU to build noise reduction model.

The project is nearly over. The result is acceptable.

Now I'm writing my paper.

After finishing my paper and defence, I will clear up the codes and instructions.

Thank you for watching my code and waiting for the completion.
